A non-lightweight, feature-rich bar using web-technologies.

**i3-web-bar** aims to enable web-developers to create beautiful widgets for a desktop bar easily.

It is not particularly a bar for the Window-Manager i3, but a general desktop-bar, but notice that the configuration in this repository is set to fulfill the requirements of a bar for i3.

It uses the [nw.js](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js) to build the UI-component in a webkit window. [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) was no option for me, as the transparency did not work on i3 + compton.
